# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Can anyone please reply, on what to do in that assignment?  

It is written that Create Expense Form is a modal which will contain the following fields
1. name
2. Date
3. Category 
4. Description
5. Amount

but in the View they are different
1. name
2. Date
3. Category 
4. Updated at
5. Amount

**Description is not there**
